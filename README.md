Alfred Workflow to browse through Google Bookmarks

#Usage
Type in 'cc' and it should load up all the folders inside of your Google Bookmarks. Currently isn't able to differentiate between folders and urls so the tree should look like folder -> URL. Will only support 1 depth of folder and then only URLs inside each folder. I will update this soon.

#Release
Go to [releases](https://github.com/LittleRandom/alfred-google-bookmarks/releases) to get the latest releases.
I'm constantly using this workflow so I'll update as necessary for me.
